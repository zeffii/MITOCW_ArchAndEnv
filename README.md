# MITOCW_ArchAndEnv
Personal study notes for this OCW course. All course materials available from  [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-111-introduction-to-architecture-environmental-design-spring-2014/readings/).

If you don't find this document (ie my notes) to be cohesive, deal with it :) *puts on shades*. I'm writing this for me, not for you. It may even contain intentional mistakes in spelling and grammar. With several other people I develop a Visual Programming plugin for Blender called "Sverchok", it attempts to give parametric control over 3d geometry. I'll get to experiment with ideas generated by this course and render a few in 3d.

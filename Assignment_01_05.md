draw threads, translating from 3d back to 2d. I'm not sure exactly what the purpose is, the explanation is just wishy-washy ( or maybe i'm hyper critical of this contextual stuff)

here's my attempt to connect two shapes via their corresponding points.
- Object 1
- Object 2 (is a flattened version of object 2)
- lines between Object 1 and 2, via points that are evenly spread on the edges of both shapes.
